changeHamletToLeon():

This method replaces occurrences of the word "Hamlet" (case-sensitive) with "Leon" and
occurrences of the word "HAMLET" (case-sensitive) with "LEON" in the hamletData string.
It uses regular expressions (Pattern and Matcher) to find and replace the occurrences.
First, a pattern is compiled to match the word "Hamlet" and then changeText() is called
with the pattern and the replacement string "Leon".
Next, a pattern is compiled to match the word "HAMLET" and then changeText() is called with
 the pattern and the replacement string "LEON".
After each call to changeText(), the hamletData string is updated with the results.
changeHoratioToTariq():

This method works similarly to changeHamletToLeon(), but it replaces occurrences of the word
"Horatio" (case-sensitive) with "Tariq" and occurrences of the word "HORATIO" (case-sensitive)
 with "TARIQ".
Again, regular expressions (Pattern and Matcher) are used to find and replace the occurrences.
First, a pattern is compiled to match the word "Horatio" and then changeText() is called with
the pattern and the replacement string "Tariq".
Next, a pattern is compiled to match the word "HORATIO" and then changeText() is called with
the pattern and the replacement string "TARIQ".
After each call to changeText(), the hamletData string is updated with the results.
changeText(Pattern pattern, String replacement):

This method takes a Pattern and a replacement string as parameters.
It creates a StringBuffer to hold the result of the replacements.
It creates a Matcher using the given pattern to search through the hamletData string.
While the matcher finds matches, it appends replacements to the StringBuffer using the
appendReplacement() method.
Once the matcher is done searching through the string, it appends the tail (remaining part
of the string) to the StringBuffer using appendTail().
Finally, it returns the updated string as the result.
findHoratio():

This method searches for the presence of the word "Horatio" in the hamletData string.
It compiles a pattern to match the word "Horatio" in a case-insensitive manner and creates
a Matcher to search through the hamletData.
It returns true if a match is found, indicating that the word "Horatio" is present, and
false otherwise.
findHamlet():

This method searches for the presence of the word "Hamlet" in the hamletData string.
It compiles a pattern to match the word "Hamlet" in a case-insensitive manner and creates
a Matcher to search through the hamletData.
It returns true if a match is found, indicating that the word "Hamlet" is present, and false
otherwise.
Overall, these methods are performing pattern matching and text replacement in the hamletData
string using regular expressions (Pattern and Matcher). The methods allow you to find the
presence of certain words and replace them as needed.
